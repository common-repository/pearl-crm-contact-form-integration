Allows Brightpearl SmartForms to be easily included in WordPress

== Description ==

The Brightpearl SmartForms plugin for WordPress allows you to quickly and easily insert lead capture forms to your blog posts or pages. Once installed and configured you can drop your chosen contact form in to your blog simply by typing {Brightpearl_smartform}.

== Installation ==

Download the plugin and remember where you have put it, then follow these 3 easy steps.

   1. Log in to WordPress and select "Add New" from the Plugins menu.
   2. Select "Upload" as the plugin source
   3. Select the file you just downloaded and click "Install Now"

On the following screen after the plugin has installed click "Activate Plugin Now"

== Configuration ==

In Brightpearl:

   1. In the "Contacts" zone select "Setup -> SmartForms"
   2. Make a note of your Brightpearl SmartForm Domain shown below your list of SmartForms
   3. Choose which form you want to be your default SmartForm and click the edit (pencil) icon
   4. Make a note of the SmartForm Code shown on the "External Link" tab

In WordPress:

   1. From the settings menu on the left hand side select "Brightpearl CRM"
   2. Enter the Brightpearl SmartForm Domain and default SmartForm Code as noted in the previous steps
   3. Save your changes to complete the configuration process.

== Usage ==

You can use the Brightpearl SmartForms plugin from within the Posts section or the Pages section. To use the form you set as your default SmartForm all you need to enter within the body of your blog post or page is:

{Brightpearl_smartform}

If you want to use a SmartForm other than the one you set as your default you can do this by adding the SmartForm Code to the end of the Brightpearl SmartForms tag for example:

{Brightpearl_smartform VHhjUaitJj10iadDaOS9s_AZ4sdXncdKDRje72PoFFw,}

To make things easy you can find the WordPress code for any SmartForm in your Brightpearl account by looking on the "External Link" tab while editing the form.
